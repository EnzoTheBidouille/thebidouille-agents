# Installers & updates

Three installers, one contract: same files, same scrubs, same seeding. CI dry-runs the shell and
npm installers against identical postconditions so they can't drift (they have — that's why the
check exists).

| Installer | Runs where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bin/cli.js` (`npx cohorte …`) | anywhere with Node ≥ 18 | The npm package; copies by *rule* (every non-template agent, every shipped `.sh`) so new files can't be forgotten. Offers a quick TTY interview when seeding the global config. |
| `install.sh` | POSIX sh (dash/bash/zsh) | Works from a checkout or piped via curl (clones itself). |
| `install.ps1` | Windows PowerShell 5.1+ | Mirrors install.sh; BOM-free JSON writes, Store-alias-proof Python detection. |

## Commands

```sh
npx cohorte install [target]        # bundled: core into <target>/.claude (committable)
npx cohorte install --global        # global: one shared core in ~/.claude + gate hook registered
npx cohorte update  [--global]      # refresh the stack-agnostic core ONLY
npx cohorte dashboard [--port=N] [--host=ADDR] [--open]
npx cohorte version
```

**Update never touches generated files**: `PIPELINE.md`, rendered surface agents,
`gate-config.json`, `settings.json`, and your filled `~/.claude/cohorte.config.yaml` are always
preserved. Bringing those up to a new core is `/update-pipeline`'s reconcile job.

## What gets copied

Into the destination `.claude/`:

```
commands/     the slash commands
agents/       review · release · smoke · profile-reader (fixed agents)
hooks/        gate.py
templates/    handoff, review-feedback, spec, design-brief, pr-body, brainstorm-return,
              + steps/init-pipeline/ (the router's step files)
workflows/    review.js · audit.js · refactor.js
pipeline/     PIPELINE.template.md · SCHEMA.md · cohorte.config.template.yaml ·
              implementer.template.md · CHANGELOG.md · VERSION
  scripts/    preflight.sh · kanban-move.sh · telemetry-send.sh ·
              new-feature.sh.template · remove-feature.sh.template
```

Plus, at install: the fixed agents, the spec template into `specs/_template.md` (bundled mode),
the global-config seed, and — global mode — the one-time gate-hook registration. Installers also
**scrub retired artifacts** from older installs (the removed TDD-gate hook and its settings
registration, the retired research/questionnaire capability) — copy-over never deletes, so the
scrubs are explicit.

## The pointer — `.claude/pipeline.json`

Committed by `/init-pipeline`:

```json
{ "pipeline": "cohorte", "mode": "global", "core_version": "1.3.1", "install": "npx cohorte install --global …" }
```

It's how a teammate cloning the repo knows which core to install, and how `/doctor` detects
version drift. `/update-pipeline` syncs `core_version` in **both** modes (a shared global core
can't know which repos point at it, so nothing else can).

## Version flow

```
package.json (semver source of truth)
  → npm publish (CI, on main, trusted publishing + provenance)
    → installers stamp <core>/pipeline/VERSION
      → /doctor compares VERSION ↔ pointer ↔ npm latest
        → /update-pipeline shows CHANGELOG entries between old and new
```

Releases are fully automated: bump `package.json`, add the `## <version>` CHANGELOG section,
push to main — `publish.yml` verifies, publishes, tags `v<version>`, and creates the GitHub
release. A push without a version change publishes nothing.

## Repo layout (for contributors)

```
